This is a original music player built from scratch with love and passion. Spotify replacement!!
right now Im alone but if anyone wants to help me then ok.
this was once a glitch.com project but glitch stopped hosting services so now I switched to vercel and github.
Some of the earliest changes might not be recorded in the version history then, 
I actually added the changelog.md and version number a long time ago
Very useful and handy website.
I actually might make more projects but right now this is the only one I have passion for.
I actually might turn this into a desktop app that works offline too, anyone willing to help me?
it is actually purely static and utilizes session local and indexed.db to store settings and your song library list.
It is highly comprehensive and relies solely on html css and js.
I will try to add features every other day to my demise.
This can be used to transcribe lyrics and as a kareoke player.
You can add songs manually from youtube or import a premade playlist.
I have provided premade playlists for people.
The website is monitored by google analytics and freevisitors counter
I hope one day this will have 10 million visits.
This repositary is just used as source code for:
deployed at sweetescape.glitch.me now sweetescape.vercel.app
Version 100?
Will I put ads I don't actually know
